 * Be able to understand and generate paths from the type and information about the type. Therefore be able to really
 * understand Spring controller. This is the most complex one, as based on current state we need to be able to find
 * out annotations on the class and method for the self. Then we also need to bea able to find how do you provide the
 * types in links and understand that their links are different. There can be only one valid mapping per type and the
 * path.
 *
 * TO BE DONE in future. Don't need this thing now.
